                                                                   Modularity




First, we want to untangle some common terms used and overused in discussions
about architecture surrounding modularity and provide definitions for use through‐
out the book.
    95% of the words [about software architecture] are spent extolling the benefits of
    “modularity” and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it.
       —Glenford J. Myers (1978)

Different platforms offer different reuse mechanisms for code, but all support some
way of grouping related code together into modules. While this concept is universal in
software architecture, it has proven slippery to define. A casual internet search yields
dozens of definitions, with no consistency (and some contradictions). As you can see
from the quote from Myers, this isn’t a new problem. However, because no recog‐
nized definition exists, we must jump into the fray and provide our own definitions
for the sake of consistency throughout the book.
Understanding modularity and its many incarnations in the development platform of
choice is critical for architects. Many of the tools we have to analyze architecture
(such as metrics, fitness functions, and visualizations) rely on these modularity con‐
cepts. Modularity is an organizing principle. If an architect designs a system without
paying attention to how the pieces wire together, they end up creating a system that
presents myriad difficulties. To use a physics analogy, software systems model com‐
plex systems, which tend toward entropy (or disorder). Energy must be added to a
physical system to preserve order. The same is true for software systems: architects
must constantly expend energy to ensure good structural soundness, which won’t
happen by accident.




                                                                                         37
Preserving good modularity exemplifies our definition of an implicit architecture
characteristic: virtually no project features a requirement that asks the architect to
ensure good modular distinction and communication, yet sustainable code bases
require order and consistency.

Definition
The dictionary defines module as “each of a set of standardized parts or independent
units that can be used to construct a more complex structure.” We use modularity to
describe a logical grouping of related code, which could be a group of classes in an
object-oriented language or functions in a structured or functional language. Most
languages provide mechanisms for modularity (package in Java, namespace in .NET,
and so on). Developers typically use modules as a way to group related code together.
For example, the com.mycompany.customer package in Java should contain things
related to customers.
Languages now feature a wide variety of packaging mechanisms, making a develo‐
per’s chore of choosing between them difficult. For example, in many modern lan‐
guages, developers can define behavior in functions/methods, classes, or packages/
namespaces, each with different visibility and scoping rules. Other languages compli‐
cate this further by adding programming constructs such as the metaobject protocol
to provide developers even more extension mechanisms.
Architects must be aware of how developers package things because it has important
implications in architecture. For example, if several packages are tightly coupled
together, reusing one of them for related work becomes more difficult.


                                   Modular Reuse Before Classes
     Developers who predate object-oriented languages may puzzle over why so many dif‐
     ferent separation schemes commonly exist. Much of the reason has to do with back‐
     ward compatibility, not of code but rather for how developers think about things. In
     March of 1968, Edsger Dijkstra published a letter in the Communications of the ACM
     entitled “Go To Statement Considered Harmful.” He denigrated the common use of
     the GOTO statement common in programming languages at the time that allowed non-
     linear leaping around within code, making reasoning and debugging difficult.
     This paper helped usher in the era of structured programming languages, exemplified
     by Pascal and C, which encouraged deeper thinking about how things fit together.
     Developers quickly realized that most of the languages had no good way to group like
     things together logically. Thus, the short era of modular languages was born, such as
     Modula (Pascal creator Niklaus Wirth’s next language) and Ada. These languages had
     the programming construct of a module, much as we think about packages or name‐
     spaces today (but without the classes).


38     |   Chapter 3: Modularity
 The modular programming era was short-lived. Object-oriented languages became
 popular because they offered new ways to encapsulate and reuse code. Still, language
 designers realized the utility of modules, retaining them in the form of packages,
 namespaces, etc. Many odd compatibility features exist in languages to support these
 different paradigms. For example, Java supports modular (via packages and package-
 level initialization using static initializers), object-oriented, and functional paradigms,
 each programming style with its own scoping rules and quirks.


For discussions about architecture, we use modularity as a general term to denote a
related grouping of code: classes, functions, or any other grouping. This doesn’t imply
a physical separation, merely a logical one; the difference is sometimes important. For
example, lumping a large number of classes together in a monolithic application may
make sense from a convenience standpoint. However, when it comes time to restruc‐
ture the architecture, the coupling encouraged by loose partitioning becomes an
impediment to breaking the monolith apart. Thus, it is useful to talk about modular‐
ity as a concept separate from the physical separation forced or implied by a particu‐
lar platform.
It is worth noting the general concept of namespace, separate from the technical
implementation in the .NET platform. Developers often need precise, fully qualified
names for software assets to separate different software assets (components, classes,
and so on) from each other. The most obvious example that people use every day is
the internet: unique, global identifiers tied to IP addresses. Most languages have some
modularity mechanism that doubles as a namespace to organize things: variables,
functions, and/or methods. Sometimes the module structure is reflected physically.
For example, Java requires that its package structure must reflect the directory struc‐
ture of the physical class files.


                 A Language with No Name Conflicts: Java 1.0
 The original designers of Java had extensive experience dealing with name conflicts
 and clashes in the various programming platforms at the time. The original design of
 Java used a clever hack to avoid the possibility of ambiguity between two classes that
 had the same name. For example, what if your problem domain included a catalog
 order and an installation order: both named order but with very different connota‐
 tions (and classes). The solution in Java was to create the package namespace mecha‐
 nism, along with the requirement that the physical directory structure just match the
 package name. Because filesystems won’t allow the same named file to reside in the
 same directory, they leveraged the inherent features of the operating system to avoid
 the possibility of ambiguity. Thus, the original classpath in Java contained only
 directories, disallowing the possibility of name conflicts.




                                                                               Definition |    39
     However, as the language designers discovered, forcing every project to have a fully
     formed directory structure was cumbersome, especially as projects became larger.
     Plus, building reusable assets was difficult: frameworks and libraries must be “explo‐
     ded” into the directory structure. In the second major release of Java (1.2, called Java
     2), designers added the jar mechanism, allowing an archive file to act as a directory
     structure on a classpath. For the next decade, Java developers struggled with getting
     the classpath exactly right, as a combination of directories and JAR files. And, of
     course, the original intent was broken: now two JAR files could create conflicting
     names on a classpath, leading to numerous war stories of debugging class loaders.



Measuring Modularity
Given the importance of modularity to architects, they need tools to understand it.
Fortunately, researchers created a variety of language-agnostic metrics to help archi‐
tects understand modularity. We focus on three key concepts: cohesion, coupling, and
connascence.

Cohesion
Cohesion refers to what extent the parts of a module should be contained within the
same module. In other words, it is a measure of how related the parts are to one
another. Ideally, a cohesive module is one where all the parts should be packaged
together, because breaking them into smaller pieces would require coupling the parts
together via calls between modules to achieve useful results.
       Attempting to divide a cohesive module would only result in increased coupling and
       decreased readability.
            —Larry Constantine

Computer scientists have defined a range of cohesion measures, listed here from best
to worst:
Functional cohesion
   Every part of the module is related to the other, and the module contains every‐
   thing essential to function.
Sequential cohesion
    Two modules interact, where one outputs data that becomes the input for the
    other.
Communicational cohesion
   Two modules form a communication chain, where each operates on information
   and/or contributes to some output. For example, add a record to the database
   and generate an email based on that information.


40     |   Chapter 3: Modularity
Procedural cohesion
    Two modules must execute code in a particular order.
Temporal cohesion
   Modules are related based on timing dependencies. For example, many systems
   have a list of seemingly unrelated things that must be initialized at system
   startup; these different tasks are temporally cohesive.
Logical cohesion
    The data within modules is related logically but not functionally. For example,
    consider a module that converts information from text, serialized objects, or
    streams. Operations are related, but the functions are quite different. A common
    example of this type of cohesion exists in virtually every Java project in the form
    of the StringUtils package: a group of static methods that operate on String
    but are otherwise unrelated.
Coincidental cohesion
    Elements in a module are not related other than being in the same source file;
    this represents the most negative form of cohesion.
Despite having seven variants listed, cohesion is a less precise metric than coupling.
Often, the degree of cohesiveness of a particular module is at the discretion of a par‐
ticular architect. For example, consider this module definition:
Customer Maintenance
  • add customer
  • update customer
  • get customer
  • notify customer
  • get customer orders
  • cancel customer orders
Should the last two entries reside in this module or should the developer create two
separate modules, such as:
Customer Maintenance
  • add customer
  • update customer
  • get customer
  • notify customer




                                                                Measuring Modularity   |   41
Order Maintenance
  • get customer orders
     • cancel customer orders
Which is the correct structure? As always, it depends:

     • Are those the only two operations for Order Maintenance? If so, it may make
       sense to collapse those operations back into Customer Maintenance.
     • Is Customer Maintenance expected to grow much larger, encouraging developers
       to look for opportunities to extract behavior?
     • Does Order Maintenance require so much knowledge of Customer information
       that separating the two modules would require a high degree of coupling to make
       it functional? This relates back to the Larry Constantine quote.

These questions represent the kind of trade-off analysis at the heart of the job of a
software architect.
Surprisingly, given the subjectiveness of cohesion, computer scientists have developed
a good structural metric to determine cohesion (or, more specifically, the lack of
cohesion). A well-known set of metrics named the Chidamber and Kemerer Object-
oriented metrics suite was developed by the eponymous authors to measure particu‐
lar aspects of object-oriented software systems. The suite includes many common
code metrics, such as cyclomatic complexity (see “Cyclomatic Complexity” on page
79) and several important coupling metrics discussed in “Coupling” on page 44.
The Chidamber and Kemerer Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) metric meas‐
ures the structural cohesion of a module, typically a component. The initial version
appears in Equation 3-1.

      Equation 3-1. LCOM, version 1
                   P − Q , if P > Q
      LCOM =
                  0,       otherwise

P increases by one for any method that doesn’t access a particular shared field and Q
decreases by one for methods that do share a particular shared field. The authors
sympathize with those who don’t understand this formulation. Worse, it has gradually
gotten more elaborate over time. The second variation introduced in 1996 (thus the
name LCOM96B) appears in Equation 3-2.




42    | Chapter 3: Modularity
   Equation 3-2. LCOM 96b

                 1 a m − μ Aj
                 a j∑
   LCOM96b =
                    =1  m

We wont bother untangling the variables and operators in Equation 3-2 because the
following written explanation is clearer. Basically, the LCOM metric exposes inciden‐
tal coupling within classes. Here’s a better definition of LCOM:
LCOM
   The sum of sets of methods not shared via sharing fields
Consider a class with private fields a and b. Many of the methods only access a, and
many other methods only access b. The sum of the sets of methods not shared via
sharing fields (a and b) is high; therefore, this class reports a high LCOM score, indi‐
cating that it scores high in lack of cohesion in methods. Consider the three classes
shown in Figure 3-1.




Figure 3-1. Illustration of the LCOM metric, where fields are octagons and methods are
squares

In Figure 3-1, fields appear as single letters and methods appear as blocks. In Class
X, the LCOM score is low, indicating good structural cohesion. Class Y, however,
lacks cohesion; each of the field/method pairs in Class Y could appear in its own
class without affecting behavior. Class Z shows mixed cohesion, where developers
could refactor the last field/method combination into its own class.




                                                                 Measuring Modularity   |   43
The LCOM metric is useful to architects who are analyzing code bases in order to
move from one architectural style to another. One of the common headaches when
moving architectures are shared utility classes. Using the LCOM metric can help
architects find classes that are incidentally coupled and should never have been a sin‐
gle class to begin with.
Many software metrics have serious deficiencies, and LCOM is not immune. All this
metric can find is structural lack of cohesion; it has no way to determine logically if
particular pieces fit together. This reflects back on our Second Law of Software Archi‐
tecture: prefer why over how.

Coupling
Fortunately, we have better tools to analyze coupling in code bases, based in part on
graph theory: because the method calls and returns form a call graph, analysis based
on mathematics becomes possible. In 1979, Edward Yourdon and Larry Constantine
published Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and
Systems Design (Prentice-Hall), defining many core concepts, including the metrics
afferent and efferent coupling. Afferent coupling measures the number of incoming
connections to a code artifact (component, class, function, and so on). Efferent cou‐
pling measures the outgoing connections to other code artifacts. For virtually every
platform tools exist that allow architects to analyze the coupling characteristics of
code in order to assist in restructuring, migrating, or understanding a code base.


                       Why Such Similar Names for Coupling Metrics?
     Why are two critical metrics in the architecture world that represent opposite con‐
     cepts named virtually the same thing, differing in only the vowels that sound the most
     alike? These terms originate from Yourdon and Constantine’s Structured Design. Bor‐
     rowing concepts from mathematics, they coined the now-common afferent and effer‐
     ent coupling terms, which should have been called incoming and outgoing coupling.
     However, because the original authors leaned toward mathematical symmetry rather
     than clarity, developers came up with several mnemonics to help out: a appears
     before e in the English alphabet, corresponding to incoming being before outgoing, or
     the observation that the letter e in efferent matches the initial letter in exit, corre‐
     sponding to outgoing connections.


Abstractness, Instability, and Distance from the Main Sequence
While the raw value of component coupling has value to architects, several other
derived metrics allow a deeper evaluation. These metrics were created by Robert Mar‐
tin for a C++ book, but are widely applicable to other object-oriented languages.



44     |   Chapter 3: Modularity
Abstractness is the ratio of abstract artifacts (abstract classes, interfaces, and so on) to
concrete artifacts (implementation). It represents a measure of abstractness versus
implementation. For example, consider a code base with no abstractions, just a huge,
single function of code (as in a single main() method). The flip side is a code base
with too many abstractions, making it difficult for developers to understand how
things wire together (for example, it takes developers a while to figure out what to do
with an AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean).
The formula for abstractness appears in Equation 3-3.

   Equation 3-3. Abstractness
        ∑ ma
   A=
        ∑ mc

In the equation, ma represents abstract elements (interfaces or abstract classes) with
the module, and mc represents concrete elements (nonabstract classes). This metric
looks for the same criteria. The easiest way to visualize this metric: consider an appli‐
cation with 5,000 lines of code, all in one main() method. The abstractness numera‐
tor is 1, while the denominator is 5,000, yielding an abstractness of almost 0. Thus,
this metric measures the ratio of abstractions in your code.
Architects calculate abstractness by calculating the ratio of the sum of abstract arti‐
facts to the sum of the concrete ones.
Another derived metric, instability, is defined as the ratio of efferent coupling to the
sum of both efferent and afferent coupling, shown in Equation 3-4.

   Equation 3-4. Instability
          Ce
   I=
        Ce + Ca

In the equation, ce represents efferent (or outgoing) coupling, and ca represents affer‐
ent (or incoming) coupling.
The instability metric determines the volatility of a code base. A code base that exhib‐
its high degrees of instability breaks more easily when changed because of high cou‐
pling. For example, if a class calls to many other classes to delegate work, the calling
class shows high susceptibility to breakage if one or more of the called methods
change.




                                                                    Measuring Modularity   |   45
Distance from the Main Sequence
One of the few holistic metrics architects have for architectural structure is distance
from the main sequence, a derived metric based on instability and abstractness, shown
in Equation 3-5.

     Equation 3-5. Distance from the main sequence
     D= A+I−1

In the equation, A = abstractness and I = instability.
Note that both abstractness and instability are fractions whose results will always fall
between 0 and 1 (except in extreme cases of abstractness that wouldn’t be practical).
Thus, when graphing the relationship, we see the graph in Figure 3-2.




Figure 3-2. The main sequence defines the ideal relationship between abstractness and
instability

The distance metric imagines an ideal relationship between abstractness and instabil‐
ity; classes that fall near this idealized line exhibit a healthy mixture of these two com‐
peting concerns. For example, graphing a particular class allows developers to
calculate the distance from the main sequence metric, illustrated in Figure 3-3.




46   |   Chapter 3: Modularity
Figure 3-3. Normalized distance from the main sequence for a particular class

In Figure 3-3, developers graph the candidate class, then measure the distance from
the idealized line. The closer to the line, the better balanced the class. Classes that fall
too far into the upper-righthand corner enter into what architects call the zone of use‐
lessness: code that is too abstract becomes difficult to use. Conversely, code that falls
into the lower-lefthand corner enter the zone of pain: code with too much implemen‐
tation and not enough abstraction becomes brittle and hard to maintain, illustrated in
Figure 3-4.

Tools exist in many platforms to provide these measures, which assist architects when
analyzing code bases because of unfamiliarity, migration, or technical debt
assessment.


                                    Limitations of Metrics
     While the industry has a few code-level metrics that provide valuable insight into
     code bases, our tools are extremely blunt compared to analysis tools from other engi‐
     neering disciplines. Even metrics derived directly from the structure of code require
     interpretation. For example, cyclomatic complexity (see “Cyclomatic Complexity” on
     page 79) measures complexity in code bases but cannot distinguish from essential
     complexity (because the underlying problem is complex) or accidental complexity (the
     code is more complex than it should be). Virtually all code-level metrics require inter‐
     pretation, but it is still useful to establish baselines for critical metrics such as cyclo‐
     matic complexity so that architects can assess which type they exhibit. We discuss
     setting up just such tests in “Governance and Fitness Functions” on page 82.


Notice that the previously mentioned book by Edward Yourdon and and Larry Con‐
stantine (Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and
Systems Design) predates the popularity of object-oriented languages, focusing
instead on structured programming constructs, such as functions (not methods). It
also defined other types of coupling that we do not cover here because they have been
supplanted by connascence.

Connascence
In 1996, Meilir Page-Jones published What Every Programmer Should Know About
Object-Oriented Design (Dorset House), refining the afferent and efferent coupling
metrics and recasting them to object-oriented languages with a concept he named
connascence. Here’s how he defined the term:
       Two components are connascent if a change in one would require the other to be
       modified in order to maintain the overall correctness of the system.
           —Meilir Page-Jones

He developed two types of connascence: static and dynamic.

Static connascence
Static connascence refers to source-code-level coupling (as opposed to execution-time
coupling, covered in “Dynamic connascence” on page 50); it is a refinement of the
afferent and efferent couplings defined by Structured Design. In other words, archi‐
tects view the following types of static connascence as the degree to which something
is coupled, either afferently or efferently:


48     | Chapter 3: Modularity
Connascence of Name (CoN)
   Multiple components must agree on the name of an entity.
    Names of methods represents the most common way that code bases are coupled
    and the most desirable, especially in light of modern refactoring tools that make
    system-wide name changes trivial.
Connascence of Type (CoT)
   Multiple components must agree on the type of an entity.
    This type of connascence refers to the common facility in many statically typed
    languages to limit variables and parameters to specific types. However, this capa‐
    bility isn’t purely a language feature—some dynamically typed languages offer
    selective typing, notably Clojure and Clojure Spec.
Connascence of Meaning (CoM) or Connascence of Convention (CoC)
   Multiple components must agree on the meaning of particular values.
    The most common obvious case for this type of connascence in code bases is
    hard-coded numbers rather than constants. For example, it is common in some
    languages to consider defining somewhere int TRUE = 1; int FALSE = 0.
    Imagine the problems if someone flips those values.
Connascence of Position (CoP)
   Multiple components must agree on the order of values.
    This is an issue with parameter values for method and function calls even in lan‐
    guages that feature static typing. For example, if a developer creates a method
    void updateSeat(String name, String seatLocation) and calls it with the
    values updateSeat("14D", "Ford, N"), the semantics aren’t correct even if the
    types are.
Connascence of Algorithm (CoA)
   Multiple components must agree on a particular algorithm.
    A common case for this type of connascence occurs when a developer defines a
    security hashing algorithm that must run on both the server and client and pro‐
    duce identical results to authenticate the user. Obviously, this represents a high
    form of coupling—if either algorithm changes any details, the handshake will no
    longer work.

Dynamic connascence
The other type of connascence Page-Jones defined was dynamic connascence, which
analyzes calls at runtime. The following is a description of the different types of
dynamic connascence:
Connascence of Execution (CoE)
   The order of execution of multiple components is important.
     Consider this code:
           email = new Email();
           email.setRecipient("foo@example.com");
           email.setSender("me@me.com");
           email.send();
           email.setSubject("whoops");
     It won’t work correctly because certain properties must be set in order.
Connascence of Timing (CoT)
   The timing of the execution of multiple components is important.
     The common case for this type of connascence is a race condition caused by two
     threads executing at the same time, affecting the outcome of the joint operation.
Connascence of Values (CoV)
   Occurs when several values relate on one another and must change together.
     Consider the case where a developer has defined a rectangle as four points, repre‐
     senting the corners. To maintain the integrity of the data structure, the developer
     cannot randomly change one of points without considering the impact on the
     other points.
     The more common and problematic case involves transactions, especially in dis‐
     tributed systems. When an architect designs a system with separate databases, yet
     needs to update a single value across all of the databases, all the values must
     change together or not at all.
Connascence of Identity (CoI)
   Occurs when multiple components must reference the same entity.
The common example of this type of connascence involves two independent compo‐
nents that must share and update a common data structure, such as a distributed
queue.
Architects have a harder time determining dynamic connascence because we lack
tools to analyze runtime calls as effectively as we can analyze the call graph.
